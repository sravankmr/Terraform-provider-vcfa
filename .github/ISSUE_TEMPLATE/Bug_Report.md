name: Bug Report
about: If something isn't working as expected in Terraform VCFA Provider

---

Hello,

Thank you for opening an issue. Please note that we try to keep the Terraform VCFA Provider issue tracker reserved
for bug reports and feature requests. For general Terraform usage questions, please see:
https://www.terraform.io/community.html.

### Terraform Version
Run `terraform -v` to show the version. If you are not running the latest version of Terraform, please upgrade because your issue may have already been fixed.

### Affected Resource(s)
Please list the resources as a list, for example:
- vcfa_org
- vcfa_region

If this issue appears to affect multiple resources, it may be an issue with Terraform's core, so please mention this.

### Terraform Configuration Files

```hcl
Copy-paste your Terraform configurations here. Please **shrink HCL replicating the bug to minimum** 
without modules. It will help us to respond and replicate the problem quicker. It may also uncover
some HCL error while doing so.

For bigger configs you may use [Gist(s)](https://gist.github.com) or a service like Dropbox and
share a link to the ZIP file.
```

### Debug Output
Please provide a link to GitHub [Gist(s)](https://gist.github.com) containing complete debug
output. You can enable debug by using the commands below:
```shell
export TF_LOG_PATH=tf.log            
export TF_LOG=TRACE                  
export GOVCD_LOG_FILE=go-vcloud-director.log
export GOVCD_LOG=true     
```

On Windows the command instead of `export` is `set`.

Replicate the issue after setting the environment variables listed above and it should create two
new files in the working directory: `tf.log` and `go-vcloud-director.log`. The `tf.log` is a general
Terraform debug log (more information about it is in
https://www.terraform.io/docs/internals/debugging.html) while the `go-vcloud-director.log` is a
specific log file for `terraform-provider-vcfa` containing debug information about performed API
calls. Please attach both of them to your [Gist](https://gist.github.com).

### Panic Output
If Terraform produced a panic, please provide a link to a GitHub Gist containing the output of the `crash.log`.

### Expected Behavior
What should have happened?

### Actual Behavior
What actually happened?

### Steps to Reproduce
Please list the steps required to reproduce the issue, for example:
1. `terraform apply`

### User Access rights
